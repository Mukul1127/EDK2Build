# EDK2Build
Repository to build OVMF and some other stuff and publish it as a Github release. Very loosely based on [rust-osdev/ovmf-prebuilt](https://github.com/rust-osdev/ovmf-prebuilt)

<b>Latest Release:</b> https://github.com/Mukul1127/EDK2Build/releases/latest

<br />

### Why does this exist?
For 3 reasons:
- This repo uses Arch instead of Debian which has slightly more updated packages.
- This repo uses the latest LLVM nightly instead of GNU Binutils.
- The repo mentioned above was 1 version out of date (when I made this).
